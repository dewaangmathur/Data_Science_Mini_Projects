# 🎯 CODSOFT Data Science Internship Project

This repository showcases the implementation of 5 real-world machine learning projects integrated into a Django web application, developed during the **CODSOFT Data Science Internship**.

Each project includes a fully trained ML model, a clean user interface for input/output, and well-documented logic to bridge data science with production-ready web apps.

## 🚀 Projects Overview & What I Did

### 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction
- **Dataset**: Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Goal**: Predict whether a passenger survived or not based on attributes like age, sex, fare, and class.
- **Approach**:
  - Performed data cleaning and label encoding.
  - Trained a **Logistic Regression** model.
  - Integrated into Django as `titanic_app` with a form input for user data.

### 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction
- **Dataset**: Indian IMDb Movies Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Goal**: Predict a movie's IMDB rating based on genre, director, and lead actor.
- **Approach**:
  - Handled categorical encoding for names using `LabelEncoder`.
  - Trained a **Random Forest Regressor**.
  - Developed a Django interface (`movie_app`) with dynamic dropdowns to select genres, directors, and actors — improving usability by eliminating guesswork for encoding.

### 🌸 Iris Flower Classification
- **Dataset**: Iris Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Goal**: Classify iris species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on petal/sepal dimensions.
- **Approach**:
  - Used clean structured CSV for flexibility over sklearn’s loader.
  - Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier**.
  - Created `iris_app` to take numeric inputs and output predicted species.

### 📈 Sales Prediction Using Advertising
- **Dataset**: Advertising Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Goal**: Predict product sales based on TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising spend.
- **Approach**:
  - Built a regression model with continuous input features.
  - Trained a **Linear Regression** model.
  - Web interface (`sales_app`) allows business users to simulate spending and get projected sales.

### 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Dataset**: Credit Card Fraud (Kaggle, anonymized)
- **Goal**: Detect fraudulent transactions in an imbalanced dataset.
- **Approach**:
  - Used undersampling to balance classes.
  - Trained a **Random Forest Classifier**.
  - Built `fraud_app` where users can simulate transaction features and get fraud predictions.
